desc: After some year without using too much linear algebra, I got a little rusty. Now it is time to revisit it, and maybe learn some new tricks.

Here I will post some notes on what I reviewed (and learned) during the Khan
Academy course in Linear Algebra.

### Linear subspaces
A set of vectors $$V$$ is a subspace if,
1. It contains the $$\overrightarrow{0}$$;
2. It is **closed under scalar multiplication**: if $$\overrightarrow{x}$$ is
   in $$V$$, then $$\alpha\overrightarrow{x}$$ is also in $$V$$ for any scalar
   $$\alpha$$;
3. It is **closed under addition**: if $$\overrightarrow{v}$$ and
   $$\overrightarrow{u}$$ are in $$V$$, then $$\overrightarrow{v} +
   \overrightarrow{u}$$ is too.


## Basis of a subspace
Is a linearly independent span, that is, the **minimum set of vectors that
spans the subspace**. Remember that if a span is generated by linearly
dependent vectors, it means that this same span can be represented with fewer
vectors.

To verify if a set of vectors is a basis of a space, then
1. Check if it spans that subspace
2. Check if it is linearly independent

Any vector in a basis can be **uniquely** represented by a **unique**
combination of scalars and vectors.
